#STEM Toolkit

Created by Akif Patel of Montville Township High School in NJ

My application is called the STEM Toolkit. This software was designed to provide 6 tools for students of Science, Engineering, Mathematics and Technology as follows:
1. Protractor - allows user to measure angles with their smartphones
2. Level - make something horizontal with the earth's surface using your phone
3. Sensors - tells user the temperature, barometric pressure, relative humidity and ambient light in the environment you are in.
4. Ruler - can use your phone to measure in centimeters
5. Equation solver - will help users solve common scientific formulas like Newton’s 2nd law or kinetic energy 
6. Constants List - a reference list of scientific & mathematical constants like Speed of Light and Pi
This can be a help to those interested in studying science and math especially since the app has a feature that allows you to copy any information to your phone’s clipboard and use with other, outside apps like the calculator.
The application was coded in the Java programming language. I used the ADK, the Android Development Kit, provided by Google, in side the Android Studio Editor. I learned the most about sensors and writing code for use with the Android platform specifically the custom view for the cut and paste feature of the app. This was very fun educational and I plan to do it again next year. You can download the actual app and the code using the link shown on the YouTube page.
